# The Checkout SpringBoot Restful Web Service

## Step 1: Shopping cart

- This application is a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.

- Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.

- The checkout functionality is implemented as a Spring REST endpoint which takes a list of products scanned at the checkout and outputs the total cost

For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05


## Step 2: Simple offers

The shop also has two new offers

- buy one, get one free on Apples

- 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges

The Update your checkout functions accordingly
